    "We are a small oil extracting firm. We own an oil reservoir that contains $s_0 = 500$ barrels of oil at time 0, and $s_t$ denotes how much oil we have in our reservoir at time $t = 0,1,2,....$ The cost of extracting oil is given by the function, $C(e_t) = e_t^2$ where $e_t$ is barrels of oil extracted at time $t$. The remaining oil in the reservoir is given by $s_{t+1} = s_t - e_t$. Extracted oil at time $t$ is sold immediately at a price of \\$30/barrel. We discount the future with a per-period discount factor $\\beta = 0.95$. We cannot leave a negative stock of oil in the ground and we cannot extract a negative amount of oil ($e_t \\geq 0$, $s_{t+1} \\geq 0$).\n",
