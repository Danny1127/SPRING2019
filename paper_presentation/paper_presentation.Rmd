## Requirements:

- 10 to 15 minutes in length
- Send me the slides by 12:00pm the day you present
- Let me know what paper you're presenting a week ahead of time
- Do not cover your slides with tons of math

## Presentation Content:

Act as if this is your own paper you are presenting.

### Applied papers
- Motivate why what you are doing is interesting
- Since this is a methodology course spend a *little* more time than usual on this for applied papers
- Explain your results
- What should we takeaway?

### Methodology papers
- Motivate why this method is interesting and useful
- Find an intuitive way to convey the method (e.g. a nice figure or gif like [this](https://twitter.com/nickchk/status/1068215492458905600))
- Explain in what situations do we want to use this method
