# AEM 7130: Spring 2019
This is the Git repository for the AEM 7130 Spring 2019 course. The repo will contain the syllabus, lecture notes, and problem sets.

## Problem sets

Problem set submissions: push your homeworks to your group's repo by the due date. Homeworks must be submitted as a well-commented and executed Jupyter notebook. See [JuliaPraxis](https://github.com/JuliaPraxis) for some best practices on commenting.
