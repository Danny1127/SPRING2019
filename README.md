# Spring 2019
This is the Git repository for the AEM 7130 Spring 2019 course. The repo will contain the syllabus, lecture notes, and problem sets.

Problem set submissions: push your homeworks to your group's repo by the due date. Homeworks must be submitted as a well-commented and executed Jupyter notebook. See [JuliaPraxis](https://github.com/JuliaPraxis) for some best practices on commenting.

To read the first lecture note correctly on your own you'll want to install the [RISE plugin](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) (will be converted to RMarkdown in the future).

Lectures:

1. [Intro to Computation]()
2. [Intro to Coding and Julia]()
3. [Intro to Git and Version Control]()
