    "1. Solve for the optimal quantity analytically. Write your proof in the notebook using markdown.\n",
    "2. Write a function called `profit_max_q(a, c, mu, sigma, method, n)` that returns the numerical optimal quantity given a set of inputs $(a, c, \\mu, \\sigma, method, n)$, where `method` is a string that takes on a value of `\"mc\"` or `\"quad\"` and determines whether you integrate using Monte Carlo or quadrature methods, and `n` is the number of Monte Carlo draws or quadrature nodes.\n",
    "3. Choose a set of values $(a, c, \\mu, \\sigma)$ and use `profit_max_q` to solve the problem for both approaches to integration. Use the `CompEcon` package to implement the quadrature routine."
