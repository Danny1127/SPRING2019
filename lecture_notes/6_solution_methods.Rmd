# Solutions to economic models

How do we solve economic models?

--

First, what do we want?

--

We want to be able to compute things like optimal policy trajectories, welfare, etc

--

There are generally two objects that can deliver what we want:

1. Value functions
2. Policy functions

--

The idea behind the different solution concepts is to recover one of these two functions

--

We recover these functions by exploiting two things:

1. Dynamic equilibrium conditions incorporating these functions (e.g. Bellman equations, Euler equations)
2. Fixed points
